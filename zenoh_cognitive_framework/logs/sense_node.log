I love learning about the natural world and how things work. I've done some hiking and camping, so I know a bit about wilderness survival, but I'm no expert. I'm more of a... philosophical person, I suppose. I like to think about the big questions and how things fit together.

I'm kinda in the same boat, I was just out for a walk and then...I don't know, everything just gets all weird and I end up here. I don't really know where 'here' is, though. Do you remember anything weird happening before you got turned around? Like, any strange noises or lights or anything?"

I've been trying to get my bearings, but every time I think I've got a sense of direction, something changes and I'm all turned around again. I've been thinking maybe we should try to find some kind of landmark or something, you know, like a stream or a ridge or something, and use that to navigate. But, I don't know, it's not like I'm some kind of expert or anything. What do you think? Maybe we could work together, try to figure this out?"
