I'm, uh, not really sure how I got here, to be honest. I don't really remember. I was just, you know, doing my thing, and then... I don't know, I must have gotten lost or something. I'm not really an outdoorsy person, I mean, I like the idea of it and all, but I'm more of a... lab kind of guy, you know? I like science and stuff. But, yeah, I'm trying to find my way out of here, I guess. Do you, uh, know the way out of these woods?"
