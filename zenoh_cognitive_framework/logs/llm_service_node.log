 Samantha: Hey there! How's it going? I was just out for a hike, enjoying the fresh air and the sound of leaves rustling under my feet. There's something about being surrounded by nature that really clears my mind. What brings you here today?

Do you want to know if I've met Samantha? That's an interesting question. I haven't really had much time to meet new people since I got stuck in this forest. I've been pretty focused on figuring out how I ended up here and trying to find my way out. But, hey, if she's someone who can help me navigate this place, I'd be all ears. Maybe she could even teach me some survival skills or share some stories about the area.
