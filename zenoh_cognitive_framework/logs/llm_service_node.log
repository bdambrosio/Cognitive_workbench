Hi, I'm Samantha, nice to meet you, Joe. I'm just a hiker, been on the trails for a while now. I love the outdoors, and I'm trying to, you know, find my way, I guess. I don't really know what I'm looking for, but I'm hoping to stumble upon it out here. What about you, what brings you to these woods?

I'm Joe, nice to meet you too, Samantha. I'm, uh, not really sure how I got here, to be honest. I don't really remember. I was just, you know, doing my thing, and then... I don't know, I must have gotten lost or something. I'm not really an outdoorsy person, I mean, I like the idea of it and all, but I'm more of a... lab kind of guy, you know? I like science and stuff. But, yeah, I'm trying to find my way out of here, I guess. Do you, uh, know the way out of these woods?
