Samantha: I think we should try to find shelter for the night, it's getting dark and I don't like the idea of being out here in the open when it's dark. I've seen some pretty dense thickets and overhangs that might provide some protection from the elements. We could try to find one of those and huddle up for the night. I'm not sure I want to keep walking in the dark, it's easy to get turned around and lost. Plus, I'm getting a bit hungry, have you found any food or water around here?
