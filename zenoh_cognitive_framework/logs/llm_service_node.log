Samantha: I'd like that, working together could be really helpful. I've been trying to find a way out of the forest for a while now, but like you said, the trails seem to shift and change, and I've been having a hard time getting my bearings. I've also been noticing that the forest seems to be... responding to me, in a way. Like, I'll be walking along, and I'll see a bird or a squirrel, and then I'll see it again a little while later, and it's like the forest is trying to tell me something. Have you noticed anything like that? And what do you think we should do first, to try and figure out what's going on and how to get out of here?
